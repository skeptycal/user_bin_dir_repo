# This is the notice from python 3.6.10 (Makefile)
#
# Generated automatically from Makefile.pre by makesetup.
# Top-level Makefile for Python
#
# As distributed, this file is called Makefile.pre.in; it is processed
# into the real Makefile by running the script ./configure, which
# replaces things like @spam@ with values appropriate for your system.
# This means that if you edit Makefile, your changes get lost the next
# time you run the configure script.  Ideally, you can do:
#
#	./configure
#	make
#	make test
#	make install
#
# If you have a previous version of Python installed that you don't
# want to overwrite, you can use "make altinstall" instead of "make
# install".  Refer to the "Installing" section in the README file for
# additional details.
#
# See also the section "Build instructions" in the README file.
